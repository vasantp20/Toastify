# **Toastify Documentation**

## **Overview**

**Toastify** is a lightweight SwiftUI framework designed to display customizable toast messages across the app. It supports persistent toasts that stay visible even when navigating between screens. This framework makes it easy to add non-intrusive, brief notifications that enhance user interaction without disrupting the app's flow.


## **Installation**

### 1. **Using Swift Package Manager**
You can add **Toastify** to your project by using Swift Package Manager:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`.
3. Enter the repository URL for **Toastify** (e.g., `https://github.com/vasantp20/Toastify.git`).
4. Follow the prompts to add the package.

### 2. **Manual Installation**
To manually add **Toastify** to your project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Drag the `Toastify` folder into your Xcode project.
3. Ensure that `Toastify` is listed under the `Link Binary with Libraries` section in your target's settings.

## **Usage**

### **Basic Toast**

You can display a simple toast message with the `showToast` function:

```swift
import Toastify

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show Toast") {
                ToastManager.shared.showToast(message: "Hello, World!")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## **Creating Custom Toast Views**
Toastify now supports customizable toast views, allowing developers to pass in their own SwiftUI views for toast messages. This new functionality provides more flexibility for designing toast messages, making it easier to adapt Toastify for different use cases.



### **Conforming to `ToastViewProtocol`**
To create a custom toast view, your view must conform to the `ToastViewProtocol`, which is essentially a protocol for SwiftUI views.

Example:

```swift
struct CustomToastView: ToastViewProtocol {
    var message: String

    var body: some View {
        Text(message)
            .font(.headline)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.red.opacity(0.8))
            .cornerRadius(12)
            .shadow(radius: 10)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show Custom Toast") {
                let customToast = CustomToastView(message: "This is a custom toast!")
                ToastManager.shared.showToast(toastView: customToast, duration: 3.0)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `CustomToastView` defines a toast with a red background and rounded corners.
- You can customize this view further by adding images, icons, or other UI elements as needed.


## **How It Works**

The `showToast(toastView:)` method does the following:
1. **Adds a custom SwiftUI view** to the appâ€™s root window, ensuring it stays visible even during navigation.
2. **Handles animations** for showing and dismissing the toast.
3. **Supports time-based dismissal**, automatically removing the toast after the specified duration.


### **Example with Navigation**

Even during navigation, toasts persist at the window level. You can display a toast before navigating to a new screen, and the message will remain visible:

```swift
Button("Navigate and Toast") {
    ToastManager.shared.showToast(message: "Navigating!")
    // Navigate to the next view
    let nextVC = UIHostingController(rootView: NextView())
    UIApplication.shared.windows.first?.rootViewController?.present(nextVC, animated: true)
}
```


## **Additional Notes**
- The custom toast view will always appear on top of the app's content, even during navigation.
- The animation ensures a smooth fade-in and fade-out effect, providing an intuitive user experience.
